# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Tweets-with-Text-Preprocessing
This Python project demonstrates how to build a sentiment classification model for tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.
Features
Preprocess raw tweet text by cleaning:

Convert to lowercase

Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags

Remove punctuation and stopwords

Vectorize cleaned text using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

Train a logistic regression classifier to label tweets as positive or negative

Evaluate model performance with accuracy and classification report

Predict sentiment on new tweet samples

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, nltk, scikit-learn

Download NLTK stopwords resource with nltk.download('stopwords')

Installation
Install required libraries via pip:

text
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn
Running the code
Prepare your tweet dataset similarly (text and sentiment labels).

Run the script or Jupyter notebook containing the preprocessing, training, and evaluation workflow.

Modify the new_tweet variable to test custom predictions.

Code Overview
preprocess_text(text): Cleans and tokenizes raw tweet text.

TfidfVectorizer(): Converts cleaned tweets to numeric feature vectors.

LogisticRegression(): Trains a binary classification model.

Metrics like accuracy and classification report provide evaluation insights.

Use Cases
Social media sentiment monitoring

Brand/product reputation analysis

Customer feedback classification
